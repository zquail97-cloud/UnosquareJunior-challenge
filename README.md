This is my submission for the World Cup 2026 Travel Route Planner, Unosquare Graduate/Junior SWE Challenge.

I chose a Node/Express backend approach for this project, building on my familiarity with the stack from my recent dissertation. I appreciate the flexibility and non-blocking nature of Node.js when building web applications and APIs.

I was able to finish and implement solutions to all of the base tasks required throughout the project, as well as the two bonus tasks for both the front and back-end components of the project.

Architecture and Design

I used a greedy algorithm to solve the Nearest-Neighbour travel route problem. I implemented date-grouping logic to ensure that the generated itinerary is physically feasible, preventing travel conflicts from occurring on the same day.

I utilised Promise.all in the budget and best-value endpoints to fetch match data, cities, and flight prices simultaneously, with the aim of reducing API latency.

Testing

I wrote unit tests for the route optimisation using Jest, employing factory functions and mock data to ensure tests are isolated and repeatable without any effects on the source data.
I implemented unit tests for the RouteMap component, mocking react-leaflet to verify proper marker rendering.

Finally, I used Postman to verify that all REST endpoints returned the correct HTTP status codes and appropriate JSON structures. Screenshots of these successful requests can be found in /postman.

AI Assistance

In line with the challenge’s guidelines, I used Google Gemini as a productivity booster. It assisted me in scaffolding the boilerplate, debugging and algorithm logic, allowing me to focus on the high-level architecture and problem solving.

I would like to thank the Unosquare team for the opportunity to work on this mock project and would be happy to answer any questions about my decision making and rationale under review.

All the best,

Zed


# World Cup 2026 Travel Route Planner

Unosquare Graduate / Junior SWE Coding Challenge

## Overview

Build a system that helps FIFA World Cup 2026 fans plan optimal travel routes between host cities based on match schedules. The tournament spans **48 teams**, **16 cities**, and **3 countries** (USA, Mexico, Canada).

See [CHALLENGE.md](./CHALLENGE.md) for `The Scenario` and full instructions.

**NOTE**: Clone this repository and copy the contents into a new repository for your account. Please share your Github URL when you are done. 

We recommend spending a maximum 2-3 hours on the challenge (excluding setup); however the time spent is entirely up to the individual.

## A Note on AI Assistance

We encourage the use of AI tools (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) to help you complete these tasks — this reflects how modern developers work.

However, **understanding matters more than output**. During review, you may be asked to:
- Explain your code and the decisions you made
- Walk through of implementation
- Discuss trade-offs and alternative approaches

Use AI as a productivity booster, not a replacement for understanding. The goal is to demonstrate your problem-solving ability and grasp of the concepts.

## Requirements

You are expected to complete the following:

1. **Implement API endpoints** — Choose one backend (Node/Express, Java/Spring, Python/Flask, or .NET) and implement all REST endpoints
2. **Implement route optimisation** — Build a `NearestNeighbourStrategy` using the Strategy Pattern
3. **Write unit tests** — Add tests to verify your route optimisation algorithm
4. **Implement frontend map component** — Build a `<RouteMap />` component using react-leaflet
5. **Document your approach** — Add comments explaining your reasoning and any trade-offs

- **.NET:** .NET 8 SDK — see [`backend/dotnet-webapi/README.md`](backend/dotnet-webapi/README.md)

## Getting Started

See each project's README for detailed setup instructions:

- **Frontend:** [`frontend/README.md`](frontend/README.md)

- **.NET:** [`backend/dotnet-webapi/README.md`](backend/dotnet-webapi/README.md)

## Testing APIs

A Postman collection is provided to help test your API endpoints.

See [`postman/README.md`](postman/README.md) for detailed import and usage instructions.

### Quick Start

1. Install [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)
2. Import [`postman/WorldCup2026_API.postman_collection.json`](postman/WorldCup2026_API.postman_collection.json)
3. Start your backend server on port 3008
4. Run requests from the collection

### Available Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Task |
|--------|----------|------|
| GET | `/api/cities` | #1 |
| GET | `/api/matches` | #2 |
| GET | `/api/matches/:id` | #2 |
| POST | `/api/route/optimise` | #3 |
| POST | `/api/route/budget` | #5 |
| POST | `/api/route/best-value` | Bonus |
| POST | `/api/itineraries` | Pre-built |
| GET | `/api/itineraries/:id` | Pre-built |

The collection uses `http://localhost:3008` as the base URL.
